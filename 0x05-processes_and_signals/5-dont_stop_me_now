# Description: Finds and terminates the 4-to_infinity_and_beyond process.

# 1. Find the PID of the running script.
# pgrep: searches for processes based on name and returns their PIDs.
# -f: search the full command line, not just the process name, to specifically match the script name.
# -o: return only the oldest (first) match, useful if multiple are somehow running.
PID=$(pgrep -f -o "4-to_infinity_and_beyond")

# 2. Check if a PID was found before attempting to kill.
if [ -n "$PID" ]; then
    # 3. Use the kill command to terminate the process.
    # By default, kill sends signal 15 (SIGTERM), which is a graceful termination request.
    kill "$PID"
    echo "Terminated process 4-to_infinity_and_beyond with PID $PID"
else
    echo "Process 4-to_infinity_and_beyond not found."

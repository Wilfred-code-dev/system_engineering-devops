# Description: Finds and terminates the 4-to_infinity_and_beyond process.

# Use pgrep to find the Process ID (PID) of the running script.
# -f: Match against the full command line.
# -o: Return only the oldest (parent) matching PID.
PID=$(pgrep -f -o "4-to_infinity_and_beyond")

# Check if a PID was found
if [ -n "$PID" ]; then
    # Use kill to send Signal 15 (SIGTERM) to gracefully stop the process.
    kill "$PID"
    # Optional: Confirmation message
    # echo "Successfully terminated 4-to_infinity_and_beyond with PID $PID"
fi

# The script exits silently if the process was killed or not found,
# allowing the shell to return to the prompt.
